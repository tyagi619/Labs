The program find the optimal path for a journey from place X to place Y based on distance, time and cost.

To run the program : swipl -s busRoute.pl

Some sample queries : 
1- route(amingaon,paltanbazar).
2- route(jalukbari,jalukbari).
3- route(jalukbari,delhi).  [Delhi is not in the place list hence it will show no path exists]
4- route(amingaon,panbazar).

The code is well documented for understanding program logic
