The program implements the Half-Sister relationship between two entities.

To run the program : swipl -s partB.pl

Some sample queries : 
1- halfsister(shivkami,avantika).
2- halfsister(avantika,shivkami).
3- halfsister(manisha,avantika).
4- halfsister(shivkami,X).
5- halfsister(X,Y).   (To view multiple possible outputs, press ; after each possible value of X and Y are displayed)

The code is well documented for understanding program logic
