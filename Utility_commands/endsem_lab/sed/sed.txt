SED

sed [-options] '[line number] s/[old]/[new]/[command]' file

s - Substitute command(Used only when you need to substitue pattern in a file)
/../../ - Delimiter
[old] - Regular Expression Pattern Search pattern
[new] - replacement string
file - filename
[line number] - reads only that line (default whole file)
                                In place of line number you can specify a expression to tell which lines to read.

                                Consider, a.txt :
                                        This is a beautiful day.
                                        It is lovely weather outside.

                                        sed -r '/Weather/I s/is/was/g' a.txt

OPTIONS
        -n - Does not print anything unless an explicit request to print is madecd
        -e - allows multiple commands in same line
        -f - reads the sed commands from file
        -r/-E - allows extended regular expression
        -i - in place editing of input file
        -l N - sets the line length N
        -s - tells sed to treat multiple files as independent files

DELIMITER
        's: : :'
        's| | |'
        's/ / /'
        All of the above are equivalent

MATCHED STRING(&)
        & - represents the matched string

        echo "123 abc" | sed 's/[0-9]+/(&)/'
        (123) abc

COMMANDS
        1) /g - Global replacement. Replace all occurances of pattern in line
        2) /[n] - Replaces the nth occurance of pattern in each line(Default n=1)
        3) /p - print the modified line.
        4)  sed 'n p' filename - prints nth line
                sed 'n,m p' filename - prints lines from n to m
        5) /w [filename] - Write the modified data into [filename]
        6) /I - Ignore case while matching pattern
        7) /d - deletes the matched pattern line
                sed '/PATTERN/d' filename
        8) n d - deletes nth line
                sed 'n d' filename
        9) n,m d - deletes all lines from n to m
                sed 'n,m d' filename
        10) 'n,m s/ / /' - reads only lines from n to m
                sed 'n,$ s/ / /' filename - $ is a special character which means last line of file
        11) 'n~m s/ / /' - starts from nth line and after it processes every mth line 
        12) 'n,+m s/ / /' - starts from nth line and reads till n+m th line        

REVERSING THE RESTRICTION WITH !
Similar to -v option in grep
        sed -n '/PATTERN/ !p' - prints line that do not match the pattern

QUIT COMMAND
        sed 'num q' - quits when it reaches [num]th line

READING A FILE WITH 'r'
        sed '/PATTERN/ r file' - reads the file after the pattern is matched. If pattern is matched multiple times, it reads file whenever pattern is matched

APPEND A LINE WITH 'a'
        sed '/PATTERN/ a\[text]' - append the text after the pattern is matched

INSERT A LINE WITH 'i'
        sed '/PATTERN/ i\[text]' - insert the text before the line on which pattern is matched

CHANGE A LINE WITH 'c'
        sed '/PATTERN/ c\[text]' - change the matched line to text

PRINT LINE NUMBER WITH '='
        sed -n '/PATTERN/ =' - prints line number of the line with matched pattern

TRANSFORM A LINE WITH 'y'
        sed 'y/abc/ABC/' - changes the occurance of 'a to 'A' , 'b' to 'B' , 'c' to 'C'

GROUPING WITH {}
        The braces are used to group sed commands
